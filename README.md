I consider myself a life-long learner, and I genuinely am passionate about tackling interesting problems and engineering solutions to them. I've worked with a multitude of backend languages and tools already, across a variety of projects, but I'm always eager to learn whatever is required to best solve the problem at hand.

I'm currently working to master Rust even further and learn more, as I work on an emulator for the original Gameboy in Rust.

When I'm not trapped behind a computer screen I enjoy unicycling.
